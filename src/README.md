_You probably already heard about Timber plugins or mods. They are quite popular.
They allow to completely cut down a tree only by breaking the bottom block.
Therefor they make it really easy to cut down big oak or jungle trees._

Just like every timber plugin this plugin allows you and your players to easily cut down trees without leaving the leaves in the air.

Optionally you can combine this plugin with CustomCrafting and create custom Timber Axes, which your players then can craft and use.
The vanilla Axes can then be toggled off, so only the Timber Axes work.
